Voice models that emulate the voice of JARVIS from the Marvel movies. Perfect to use for voice in Home Assistant: [docs](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/piper/DOCS.md#custom-voices)

If you want to use these models in Home Assistant using the Piper add-on, simply copy the `<MODEL>.onnx` and `<MODEL>.onnx.json` file into the `/share/piper` directory of Home Assistant. After restarting Home Assistant you should see the voice available when configuring a new Assistant. To do this, go to the "Assistants" page in the Home Assistant settings and click "Add Assistant" and choose the voice under "Text-to-speech".
